Somewhat steampunk setting, with a weird mix of technology, and very cold.

Hydrocarbons are used, but barely. Mostly as rocket propellant. Internal combustion engines may or may not be a thing.

Submarine is either run on fancy new internal combustion engine, or nuclear reactor (honestly I kinda love the idea of a nuclear powered steam engine).

It's generally cold, and things are generally covered in ice. The port our ship leaves from is on the edge of a continually proceeding ice sheet. For either anthropogenic or natural the world is going into a glacial age. This is likely to have uncomfortable effects for humanity, and this is heavily on the minds of the scientific community.
