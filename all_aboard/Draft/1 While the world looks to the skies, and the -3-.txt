While the world looks to the skies, and the promise of a bright future, the SUPER AWESOME SHIP sets sail to descend into the darkness of the oceans. Below the ice, the ocean holds darkness, living creatures that wouldn't mind if the sun went out tomorrow, and memories that should not have been forgotten.

The depths attack your vessel with increased force at every fathom, searching for a week spot, fighting to enter, to destroy the little bit of liveable environment you brought with you. The dark and cold of the ocean welcome you, but they do not want to let you escape.
