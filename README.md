All Aboard
==========

A crew, a ship, and the darkness of the ocean. An ocean who's citizens wouldn't mind if the sun went out tomorrow. An ocean which holds memories that should not have been forgotten.

An ocean that does not happily allow trespassers to leave.

This is a novel, written for [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org) 2016.

all_aboard/ is a [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) sync directory, where all the actual writing happens, because Scrivener is great and lets me get away with this kind of BS.
